// it is a collection of nodes that might point to each other
// the nodes represent the real life entities 
// the edges which connect them represnt relatioship
// these nodes are called vertex
// types of graphs
// on the basis of direction 
// 1 --> directed
// 2 --> undirected
// edge weight
// 1 --> weighted
// 2 --> unweighted

// terminologys
// 1 --> multi graph = undirected graph with multiple edges bwt two nodes
// 2 --> simple graph = undirected graph with no multiple edges and loops
// 3 --> complete graph = every node is directly connected to the every other node
// dag (directed acyclic graph)
// degree --> degree of a vertex in a graph is the total no of edges incident to it or away 
//              from it (indegree,outdegree)
